# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand, clean, and analyze raw datasets. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data and transform it into a meaningful and analysis-ready format for business insights or further modeling.

EDA is a critical first step in any data science or data analytics workflow, and this project demonstrates practical, real-world data analysis skills using Python.
